# GiphyCollector

## Overview
Gif API using Javascript, AJAX, JQuery, and HTML

## How the app works
The purpose is to allow the user to pull gifs from Giphy without being limited to any certain type. The user is able to add keywords into the input field and left click 'Submit'. This will create a new button which will render 10 gifs along with their ratings pertaining to the keyword. The user is able to create as many buttons as needed as the HTML is using bootstrap to be responsive.
